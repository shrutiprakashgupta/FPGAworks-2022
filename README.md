# FPGAworks

## About

FPGAworks is a Capture the Flag event designed around **Programmable Hardware Development**. The tasks here include analyzing RTL code, communicating with the board, performing on-chip debug & understanding the capabilities and challenges of working on bare metal. The aim is to explore as many features of FPGA boards and RTL design as possible, so come with an open mindset and don't hesitate in googling!
 
This event is a part of **Hackrush**, the Annual Coding Fest of the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.

## Note

The challenges are based on Xilinx Artix-7 Basys 3 FPGA board. The Vivado Lab Edition tool suffices the need for programming and debugging with the board. Other than this, some open source tools might be needed (or might prove to be helpful) like [GTKwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) and [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/). 

The solutions to all of the problems are included in the `solutions` directory. These are mainly the scripts and a note on the steps to be taken in other cases (for ex. working with the FPGA board). The `misc` directory includes a zipped version of the CTFd instance used for this event. It can be imported into another CTFd instance if anyone is interested in setting up this CTF challenge.

# FPGAworks

FPGAworks is a Capture the Flag event designed around **Programmable Hardware Development**. The tasks here include analyzing RTL code, communicating with the board, performing on-chip debug & understanding the capabilities and challenges of working on bare metal. The aim is to explore as many features of FPGA boards and RTL design as possible, so come with an open mindset and don't hesitate in googling!
 
This event is a part of **Hackrush**, the Annual Coding Fest of the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.

# Description

A specific combination of all 16 switches on the board will show the flag. You can try all possible combinations or just use your third eye.   
# Hint

Each valid signal corresponds to one switch on the board. Once you have arrived on the required combination of all 16 switches, press the centre push button to get the flag.

# Hint 
Worth (20 points)

An Integrated Logic Analyzer core is already included in the RTL code. This allows you to read internal signals. Have a look on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjeTOf6ACI) video at 20:00 for more information.

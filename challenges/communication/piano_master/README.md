# Description

Who hasn't played Piano Master. The game where you see the falling tiles on different piano keys and you have to play them back. The task here is similar. The board will give you an alphabet a time, and you have to respond with the same. If you play a wrong chord, you will lose and have to start from the beginning. Once you complete the song, you'll get the flag but mind it that the song is *long*.

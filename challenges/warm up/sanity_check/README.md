## FPGAworks

**Welcome to FPGAworks!** 
Throughout this event, you will be working with the [Basys3 FPGA board](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start).  [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWgi3a6A9Vo) video gives an introduction to the board. And [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Nv1z0w7IXM) video shows how to program the board.   
## Tool Setup:

Xilinx Vivado tools are best to be used with Digilent Basys3 board. **Vivado Lab Edition** is a low weight tool which you can install on your system to aid you in programming and debugging Basys3. However, it does not support writing Verilog code & has lower functionality than the Vivado Design Suite but will suffice for this event. 
</br>
If you plan to install this tool, the [Self Extracting Web Installer version 2020.3](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2020-3.html) will be a good and stable choice.  Also, note that for Linux systems, you would have to install the cable drivers manually. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ-w-9qQD0s) video shows the installation procedure. 
</br>
## Flag Description: 

Throughout the CTF, flags will follow a unique format as `FPGAworks{this_is_the_flag}`.  For ex, if the flag is given by input/output signal values as `11101111` the flag will be `FPGAworks{11101111}`.

##### Note

The tool usage mentioned above is just a suggestion. You are free to use any other tool if you like.
